Apache/AxKit/Provider/CGI version 0.01
======================================

AxKit has a very powerful Taglib architecture that allows you to
separate you content from your presentation.

This module provides an alternative to taglibs. The general philosphy
here is to respond to http requests with perl cgi scripts. Such scripts
perform two duties. First, they generate content. Second, they determine
the stylesheet for presenting the content. The cgi scripts do not
generate the stylesheets. They simply determine which stylesheet should
be used for presentation.

CGI scripts must contain a "content()" subroutine that returns a hashref
containing the generated content, and optionally, the name of a stylesheet.

The hashref is converted to XML and wrapped in a <response> tag using
XML::Simple. If the cgi script specifies a stylesheet, an appropriate
processing instruction is prepended to the xml document.

This xml document is then provided to AxKit for further processing.
